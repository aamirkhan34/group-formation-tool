            CSCI5308 is in desperate need of tool support and automation before it becomes a core
            required course in the MACS program and enrollment jumps from an average of 30 students to
            120 students. We need a tool to facilitate the organization of students into groups, and to
            organize, track and display the results of peer group assessments.
